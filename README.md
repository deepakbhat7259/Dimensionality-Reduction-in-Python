### Dimensionality-Reduction-in-Python
- Problem of Multicollinearity, lead to Overfitting
- Dimesionality reduction reduces dimension and not loose any information
#### 01 Curse of Dimensionality (Theory)
- Risk of Overfitting
#### 02 Correlation (Theory)
- Strength and Relationship between two variables
